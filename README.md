# Github Webhook Docker Stop

A solution for interact with docker api local with a simple web server for listen events from github webhook 

## How works?

The golang app interact with the docker api for search and stop the containers with a specific label (`projectName` & `pullRequestNumber`).

*This labeling is mandatory for the containers that you want to detain.*

## Requirements

* Docker Engine :heart:
* Go 1.17

## Getting Started

### Docker :heart:

You only run this command in your terminal:

```
docker run -p :8080 \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-e GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET \
ghcr.io/enriquetejeda/github-webhook-docker-stop:latest
```

### Standalone

1. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the values
2. Compile with the command `make build`
3. Run the command `make run`

## Development

### Building the binary

I provided a makefile for do this job, only run this command:
```
make build 
```
### Building the container

I provided a makefile for do this job, only run this command:
```
